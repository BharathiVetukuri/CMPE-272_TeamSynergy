Event Calendar Check out our calendar for all of SJSU's upcoming events for students. Student Testimonials Rowan Rajani '25 Psychology When I was a freshman, CAPISE was not established, and I felt very isolated and alone in my experience. CAPISE gave me a place to explore not only my cultural identity, but how my other identities inform and influence my experiences and time here at San Jose State. I feel more connected to myself, my peers, and my community. Sarab Multani '25 Public Health Student Affairs does a great job of empowering students to be innovators and create your own path to success. And I think that the Student Affairs' Student Involvement department is the #1 resource for students on campus. Hannah Bittar '23 Biology One of the best decisions I made while being a student at SJSU is making the decision to be a Peer Educator for 3 years. I took on different roles to support and guide my fellow students. As an S.I. Leader for the first 2 years, I facilitated group tutoring sessions in Biology and Chemistry. These interactive sessions allowed my peers to grasp high-yield topics and enhance their academic success, which was very rewarding for me to witness.

Our students’ trajectory is upward, regardless of where they start. They have the opportunity to graduate with increased future earnings and less than half the average student debt of their California counterparts. And they go on to work in some of the world’s most influential companies. As alumni of SJSU, they join our faculty and staff in positively impacting Silicon Valley, the Bay Area and beyond. We are SJSU — transformation defined. Share Your Story Testimonials of Transformation Cornelio (CJ) Balmaceda ’20 Justice Studies “I was never even supposed to be in college, let alone get accepted to SJSU. But the moment I stepped onto campus, everything changed for the better. One of the best ways SJSU transformed my life was by being introduced to lifelong friends and developing many connections. I will forever cherish my days at SJSU, and because I attended there, I am a better individual. Thank you SJSU!” Tara Caughlan ’16 MA Environmental Studies “I met so many amazing students and staff at SJSU. In the environmental studies program, I was surrounded by people who wanted to make the world a better place. I now work at the San Francisco Zoo, which is dedicated to conservation, both local and distant. My studies at SJSU helped me see the plight of animals in a much larger context. Thank you, SJSU!” Tommy Wen Chin ’22 Physics “[My SJSU professor] gave me the courage that I had been longing for to pursue physics. Every day since then, I have been very grateful for the opportunity to pursue what I truly love.” Laurel Eby ’10 MA Library and Information Science “I was a stay-at-home mom for 10 years when I decided to go back to school to get a master's degree in library and information science. A year after I graduated I started working at the King Library in February 2012, and just finished my ninth year there. I love working in the MLK Library, and on the SJSU campus. San José State truly transformed my life!” Alec Giurlani Academic Advisor, H&A Student Success Center “As a student at SJSU, I was diagnosed with Stage 3 cancer. The entire College of Humanities and the Arts was so understanding and worked with me through my whole cancer journey. I never expected SJSU to be such a kind and loving family. Thankfully, I am now more than five years cancer-free and working full time at SJSU as an academic advisor. I’m grateful for SJSU and the opportunity to give back.” Carl Henderson ’04 African American Studies “My time at SJSU was a great transformation. As a transfer student from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, I arrived in San José deflated and depressed. I found positivity and inspiration within the Xi Gamma Chapter of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity. After graduation I pursued coaching...with the life mission of ‘encouraging students to have a dream and admonishing them to have courage through adversity.’ My time at SJSU, though full of trials and tribulations, was the greatest time of my life.” Marielle Lacanlale ’22 Nursing “If I had not gone to SJSU to pursue nursing, I would not have been able to develop the work ethic that I have now to achieve my goals. SJSU has also provided me with a very strong Filipino community. I had also grown a very close knit friend group that has been able to support me in my journey throughout college. Now that I am in the nursing school here, SJSU has provided me with so many opportunities to make a difference within my community.” Alexandra Salazar ’20 Molecular Biology “Coming to SJSU introduced me to the mentors that would see my potential and help transform me into the scientist I am becoming. Thanks to the resources and guidance I received at SJSU, I will begin pursuing my PhD in neuroscience at the Scripps Research Institute starting fall 2021.” Norman K. Tuitavuki ’17 MA Transportation Management “I completed a graduate degree from San Jose Staté University several years ago. Without this formal training, I don’t know where I’d be at this moment in my life. The education I received from San Jose Staté has given me the tools I need to advance my career upward.” Footer San José State University SJSU on Facebook SJSU on Twitter SJSU on LinkedIn SJSU on Instagram SJSU on YouTube One Washington SquareSan José, CA 95192 408-924-1000 SJSU Online Accessibility Accreditation Title IX Diversity Land Acknowledgement Privacy Colleges Business Education Engineering Graduate Studies Health and Human Sciences Humanities and the Arts Information, Data and Society Professional Education Science Social Science Resources A-Z Index Annual Security Report [pdf] Bookstore Calendars Careers and Jobs Catalog Current Students Emergency Food & Housing Faculty & Staff Freedom of Speech King Library NewsCenter Parenting Students Parking and Maps Contact Us Contact Form Directory Doing Business with SJSU Emergency Info File a Complaint Report a Title IX Complaint Last Updated Apr 6, 2024",

Event Calendar Check out our calendar for all of SJSU's upcoming events for students. Student Testimonials Rowan Rajani '25 Psychology When I was a freshman, CAPISE was not established, and I felt very isolated and alone in my experience. CAPISE gave me a place to explore not only my cultural identity, but how my other identities inform and influence my experiences and time here at San Jose State. I feel more connected to myself, my peers, and my community. Sarab Multani '25 Public Health Student Affairs does a great job of empowering students to be innovators and create your own path to success. And I think that the Student Affairs' Student Involvement department is the #1 resource for students on campus. Hannah Bittar '23 Biology One of the best decisions I made while being a student at SJSU is making the decision to be a Peer Educator for 3 years. I took on different roles to support and guide my fellow students. As an S.I. Leader for the first 2 years, I facilitated group tutoring sessions in Biology and Chemistry. These interactive sessions allowed my peers to grasp high-yield topics and enhance their academic success, which was very rewarding for me to witness.

And they go on to work in some of the world’s most influential companies. As alumni of SJSU, they join our faculty and staff in positively impacting Silicon Valley, the Bay Area and beyond. We are SJSU — transformation defined. Share Your Story Testimonials of Transformation Cornelio (CJ) Balmaceda ’20 Justice Studies “I was never even supposed to be in college, let alone get accepted to SJSU. But the moment I stepped onto campus, everything changed for the better. One of the best ways SJSU transformed my life was by being introduced to lifelong friends and developing many connections. I will forever cherish my days at SJSU, and because I attended there, I am a better individual. Thank you SJSU!” Tara Caughlan ’16 MA Environmental Studies “I met so many amazing students and staff at SJSU. In the environmental studies program, I was surrounded by people who wanted to make the world a better place. I now work at the San Francisco Zoo, which is dedicated to conservation, both local and distant. My studies at SJSU helped me see the plight of animals in a much larger context. Thank you, SJSU!” Tommy Wen Chin ’22 Physics “[My SJSU professor] gave me the courage that I had been longing for to pursue physics. Every day since then, I have been very grateful for the opportunity to pursue what I truly love.” Laurel Eby ’10 MA Library and Information Science “I was a stay-at-home mom for 10 years when I decided to go back to school to get a master's degree in library and information science. A year after I graduated I started working at the King Library in February 2012, and just finished my ninth year there. I love working in the MLK Library, and on the SJSU campus. San José State truly transformed my life!” Alec Giurlani Academic Advisor, H&A Student Success Center “As a student at SJSU, I was diagnosed with Stage 3 cancer. The entire College of Humanities and the Arts was so understanding and worked with me through my whole cancer journey. I never expected SJSU to be such a kind and loving family. Thankfully, I am now more than five years cancer-free and working full time at SJSU as an academic advisor. I’m grateful for SJSU and the opportunity to give back.” Carl Henderson ’04 African American Studies “My time at SJSU was a great transformation. As a transfer student from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, I arrived in San José deflated and depressed. I found positivity and inspiration within the Xi Gamma Chapter of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity. After graduation I pursued coaching...with the life mission of ‘encouraging students to have a dream and admonishing them to have courage through adversity.’ My time at SJSU, though full of trials and tribulations, was the greatest time of my life.” Marielle Lacanlale ’22 Nursing “If I had not gone to SJSU to pursue nursing, I would not have been able to develop the work ethic that I have now to achieve my goals. SJSU has also provided me with a very strong Filipino community. I had also grown a very close knit friend group that has been able to support me in my journey throughout college. Now that I am in the nursing school here, SJSU has provided me with so many opportunities to make a difference within my community.” Alexandra Salazar ’20 Molecular Biology “Coming to SJSU introduced me to the mentors that would see my potential and help transform me into the scientist I am becoming. Thanks to the resources and guidance I received at SJSU, I will begin pursuing my PhD in neuroscience at the Scripps Research Institute starting fall 2021.” Norman K. Tuitavuki ’17 MA Transportation Management “I completed a graduate degree from San Jose Staté University several years ago. Without this formal training, I don’t know where I’d be at this moment in my life. The education I received from San Jose Staté has given me the tools I need to advance my career upward.” Footer San José State University SJSU on Facebook SJSU on Twitter SJSU on LinkedIn SJSU on Instagram SJSU on YouTube One Washington SquareSan José, CA 95192 408-924-1000 SJSU Online Accessibility Accreditation Title IX Diversity Land Acknowledgement Privacy Colleges Business Education Engineering Graduate Studies Health and Human Sciences Humanities and the Arts Information, Data and Society Professional Education Science Social Science Resources A-Z Index Annual Security Report [pdf] Bookstore Calendars Careers and Jobs Catalog Current Students Emergency Food & Housing Faculty & Staff Freedom of Speech King Library NewsCenter Parenting Students Parking and Maps Contact Us Contact Form Directory Doing Business with SJSU Emergency Info File a Complaint Report a Title IX Complaint Last Updated Apr 6, 2024",

In the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and College Pulse’s 2025 Best Colleges in the U.S. rankings, released Thursday, SJSU ranked as the #4 best public university in the nation and #16 overall. The rankings, which rate the top 500 universities in the country, measure how well each college sets graduates up for financial success, how much a school improves students’ chances of graduating and their future earnings and balances these outcomes with feedback from students on college life. SJSU vaulted 157 spots from last year’s overall rankings. “San José State is a premier public university in the country, and we are thrilled this ranking highlights what many Spartans already know — SJSU prepares students to succeed as graduates and transform their lives,” said President Cynthia Teniente-Matson. “We are the anchor institution of the Epicenter of the Future here in Silicon Valley, and our tremendous students, faculty, staff, alumni and community deserve the credit for making this university a world-class institution.” In additional rankings, SJSU ranked #5 among public universities, and #17 overall, for Best Salaries, which according to WSJ, “lists schools in order of their impact on graduates’ salaries and how this relates to the cost of attending the college.” The university also ranked #28 for social mobility and #42 for best value in the nation. SJSU is no stranger to strong rankings from WSJ. Last year, SJSU earned several top rankings among public universities for salaries for graduates: #1 in accounting #2 in marketing #4 in data science #5 in engineering #6 in software development Related Stories SJSU Named Fulbright HSI Leader by the U.S. Department of State for Fourth Year Running Deep Dive in Five: Fifth Annual GIS Day Focuses on Democracy SJSU Hosts Inaugural First-Gen Week Celebration First-Year Writing Program Presents the Inaugural Digital Literacy Expo Share this post: Share on X (Twitter) Share on Facebook Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Email Pages Stories For the Media Subscribe About NewsCenter Categories Academics Athletics Awards and Achievements Campus Life Community Engagement Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Leadership Research and Innovation Spartan Spotlight SJSU Sites SJSU.edu Accessibility Accreditation Title IX Diversity Land Acknowledgement Privacy Washington Square: the Magazine",

San José State University has launched the College of Information, Data and Society (IDS), the first college of its kind in the CSU system. Under the leadership of Provost and Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs Vincent Del Casino, Jr., IDS is home to the School of Information (iSchool) and the Department of Applied Data Science. “We are nationally and globally recognized for shaping the future of the workforce, preparing students for career paths that exist today and those that have yet to be created and all of this is being realized in this new college,” said Del Casino. The college, formed last spring, is being led by Interim Dean Michael Meth, who is also the dean of the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Library. This new college also represents a cross-campus strategy to expand access to degrees that crosscut information and data sciences, and gives SJSU the capacity to enhance its role as a workforce development leader in the fields of information and library science, artificial intelligence (AI), big data analytics and ethics, instructional design, and cybersecurity at the undergraduate and graduate levels. SJSU is launching a search for a permanent dean for IDS this fall. “Putting these programs together into one college is yet another example of SJSU maximizing its resources and innovating to the benefit of our students,” said SJSU President Cynthia Teniente-Matson. “We are at a pivotal moment in the future of information. SJSU intends to lead our students into that future, ensuring they will be well-prepared to meet this moment.” Vincent Del Casino, Jr. introduces the College of IDS. The iSchool prepares students for careers as information professionals in diverse areas such as libraries and librarianship, user experience design, digital asset management, information architecture, electronic records management, information governance and digital preservation. The Applied Data Science Department offers academic programs to address emerging workforce demands of interdisciplinary talents designing and deploying intelligent solutions to real-world data challenges. The debut of IDS comes as SJSU prepares to host the annual Public Interest Technology University Network (PIT-UN) convening on campus November 7-8, 2024. PIT-UN is a collaboration among dozens of higher education institutions committed to building the field of public interest technology.

Photo by Jim Gensheimer. First-year writing students will present interactive projects at the inaugural Digital Literacy Expo. On November 22, San José State’s First-Year Writing (FYW) Program is proud to present its first-ever Digital Literacy Expo, an interactive showcase of student work spotlighting digital works in progress. The event is part of an ongoing digital literacy initiative supported by Adobe Systems and the Office of the Provost at SJSU, as well as a California State University Supported Pathways grant to support instruction in first-year writing. Associate Professor of Rhetoric and Writing Ryan Skinnell serves as the director of the First-Year Writing Project and is partnering with Amanda Smith, coordinator of the Stretch English program (a one-year program that divides English 1A into two semesters), to host the event. “We define digital literacy in terms of texts, broadly defined, that appear in digital spaces,” Skinnell says. “If I write a paper for class, how might that be put into different media? It could be available to people on a website or turned into a video or podcast.” Participating students have the opportunity to present assignments created using a variety of Adobe tools. In addition to Skinnell and Smith’s students, five other first-year writing classes will contribute work for the expo. Assignments are fairly open-ended, depending on the class; Skinnell’s students are expected to produce an op-ed about voting rights, while another instructor’s class is creating work that examines environmental texts. The event will take place in rooms 4A/4B on the second floor of the Lupe and Compean Diaz Student Union, where the public is invited to circulate to speak with students about their projects on display. Mia Castillo Garcia, ’28 Biological Sciences, plans to present a project dedicated to her family at the expo on Nov. 22. “In my English class, we were assigned to connect our favorite food with a memory [by creating] a web page,” she explains. “I immediately thought of lomo saltado (beef stir fry), my favorite Peruvian dish, which reminds me of an unforgettable and bittersweet memory of my mother teaching me how to make it while undergoing chemotherapy for cancer.” Castillo Garcia adds that the assignment allowed her to share her story “not only with words, but also images of the dish, creating a richer and more meaningful experience.” The experience has also challenged her to experiment with various storytelling tools. “Learning to use AI-generated images and other digital tools has shown me the power of digital literacy, and I believe we should all embrace these tools to further our participation in today’s society,” she says. “I discovered a love for turning my writing into web pages and videos which I might never have explored otherwise. Everyone can find a unique way to share their stories; it’s just a matter of finding what fits you best.” Emphasizing the creative process Ryan Skinnell participated in SJSU’s 2024 First-Year Writing Digital Literacy Symposium in August for writing teachers who want to learn to incorporate different modalities for composition into their teaching. Photo by Robert C. Bain.“The Digital Literacy Expo offers a different way to think about the curriculum,” says Skinnell. “We’re not replacing traditional essays by any stretch of the imagination, but we’re thinking about how students engage with writing and reading in their classes when they go to work out in the world.” Students are experimenting with Adobe products and other digital tools that sometimes incorporate artificial intelligence (AI), which Skinnell hopes will prompt productive dialogue about how to appropriately incorporate AI into creative and academic writing. “We as writing teachers now have the opportunity to think about what we bring to the work of teaching writing if a polished text can be produced by robots,” he says. “AI can produce at the drop of a hat, but it can’t figure out how to work through feedback and incorporate things from class discussion over a series of iterations.” Those iterations make up the real act of writing and rewriting, he says, and offer students the chance to experiment with various forms of storytelling. Skinnell hopes that the inaugural Digital Literacy Expo helps all First-Year Writing students understand that there are many ways to present their work, with an emphasis on the drafting, revising and rewriting processes. “Our students are starting to think really early in their first-year writing classes about how they write and produce the knowledge that will carry them through their majors,” he says. “The things that students produce may surprise them. I’m very curious to see what they produce.” Learn more about the Digital Literacy Expo on Nov. 22.

Photo by Javier Duarte. Every year, the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA) recognizes select Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) as Fulbright HSI Leaders for their strong engagement with the Fulbright program. As of November 4, San José State is proud to be named a 2023-2024 Fulbright HSI Leader for the fourth consecutive year. San José State is one of four California State Universities (CSUs) included in the list. The recognized colleges and universities include seven associate’s colleges, five baccalaureate colleges, two special focus institutions, 10 master’s colleges and universities, and 28 doctoral universities. The initiative encourages administrators, faculty and students at HSIs to engage with Fulbright and highlights the strength of HSIs as destinations for international students and scholars. The U.S. Department of State has a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU), the goal of which is to increase the awareness of and participation by the Hispanic community of the United States in the Fulbright Program and in other exchange programs supported by the U.S. Department of State. “I am confident that our engagement with the program will continue to grow as we advance our shared priority of teaching our talented and diverse students – the world’s future leaders – to become active and engaged participants in our increasingly interconnected, interdependent global economy and society,” said CSU Chancellor Mildred García, a two-time Fulbrighter herself. “My Fulbright experiences have enriched my personal and professional lives in immeasurable ways.” HSI students and faculty who have taken part in Fulbright opportunities come back to their campuses with new insights, and leaders of HACU-member institutions appreciate the long-term research partnerships and international collaborations made possible through Fulbright. Scott Weinhold, Senior Bureau Official for the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, commended the 2024 Fulbright HSI Leaders for their support of the Fulbright Program. Weinhold said, “Fulbrighters from HSIs contribute to the Program’s goal of reflecting the full diversity, perspectives, and talents of the American people.” About the Fulbright Program The Fulbright Program is the U.S. government’s flagship international academic exchange program with a longstanding commitment to diversity, working to ensure that participants reflect the United States and societies abroad. The Fulbright Program works closely with the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) to promote international exchange opportunities to staff, students and faculty at HSIs. This year’s Fulbright HSI Leaders were announced at the HACU Annual Conference. Fulbright also works with Historically Black Colleges and Universities, the National Clearinghouse on Disability and Exchange, the American Association of Community Colleges, Diversity Abroad and many more organizations. Since 1946, the Fulbright Program has provided more than 400,000 students, scholars, artists and teachers from all types of institutions the opportunity to study, teach and conduct research abroad. Fulbrighters build connections, gain experience, exchange ideas and address global challenges. Fulbright is a program of the U.S. Department of State, with funding provided by the U.S. government. Participating governments and host institutions, corporations and foundations around the world also provide direct and indirect support to the program.

Her Energy Materials Lab will “contribute to the understanding of the interface between aqueous electrolytes and electrodes” for the Aqueous Battery Consortium. Photo by Robert C. Bain. San José State recently joined the Aqueous Battery Consortium, an energy hub research project supported by the Department of Energy (DOE) and led by Stanford University and SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. The project aims to find a reliable, sustainable way to store electricity, partially by creating a rechargeable battery made mostly of water (the “aqueous” part of the consortium) and other abundant materials. The project may receive up to $62.5 million over five years as part of the DOE’s Energy Innovation Hubs program. Current aqueous batteries, including lead-acid batteries, don’t hold much energy, and the lead they contain is harmful. Lithium-ion batteries, another current option, aren’t cost-effective. This new consortium aims to make the new batteries more environmentally safe, much cheaper to produce and more efficient. The team consists of 31 leading battery scientists, engineers and physicists from 12 universities in North America, as well as from SLAC, the U.S. Army Research Lab and the U.S. Naval Research Lab. San José State’s contribution to the project comes through Dahyun Oh, associate professor of materials engineering. She is on two of the nine teams that structure the project: the interface team and the team on materials design and synthesis. She adds, “My lab, the Energy Materials Laboratory, will contribute to the understanding of the interface between aqueous electrolytes and electrodes. In batteries, interfaces play a crucial role in enabling battery reactions, and the interfacial behavior with aqueous electrolytes is less understood compared to organic electrolyte systems.” Her team feels “grateful and fortunate” to be included in this effort, which she believes will help people “recognize the potential of SJSU, its faculty and its students.” “This is an absolutely groundbreaking opportunity for my career, as well as for the SJSU students who will join this project,” she says. “Collaborative research is especially important for students at minority-serving institutions (MSI), as they have fewer opportunities to engage with graduate or postgraduate-level researchers. This consortium will provide a golden opportunity for students to learn, engage, develop research skills and build networks.” After all, a next-generation, environmentally-friendly battery could help power the world, and SJSU will be an integral part of this effort. As Oh concludes, “We have numerous opportunities to offer, and our national recognition continues to grow.” Learn more about the Aqueous Battery Consortium.

I knew that my professors were always available if I needed help. Despite the pandemic, I pushed myself and got straight A’s in fall 2020 — I’m proud of that.” —Joshua Reyes, ’23 Marketing “I chose SJSU because I had heard so many good things about it, and once I went to Admitted Spartan Days, I knew that I felt at home. I loved the campus and it seemed like the perfect place to be able to meet new people and find my own place in the Spartan community.” —Madison Wong, ’23 Psychology “Everywhere else I had applied, I had seen or visited in person. But I realized that SJSU was a really solid option for me after I followed SJSU social media and attended the online Admitted Spartans activities. It was really nice attending all the online events with my parents in our living room.” —Cathy Hernandez, ’24 Software Engineering A Transformative College Experience San José State is your connection to a dynamic community focused on helping you shape your future.

But what is a Spartan at SJSU? A soldier, an athlete, a scholar, a professor? On our campus, a Spartan can be an engineer, an educator, an artist, a philosopher, a scientist — an advocate for justice and equality.In my eight years interviewing SJSU students, alumni, faculty, staff and community members, I’ve observed that Spartans share a common value: A strong desire to create a better world.Some lay the foundation on the mat in the dojo, à la Yoshihiro Uchida, ’47 Biological Sciences, ’04 Honorary Doctorate, who dedicated more than 75 years to training Olympic-caliber judokas. Others establish spaces like the Kogura Gifts store in San José’s historic Japantown, surviving and thriving beyond World War II and the COVID-19 pandemic. No mention of San José State athletics history would be complete without the late Lawrence Fan, proverbial torchbearer for generations of student-athletes, coaches and sports media professionals.Some Spartans make their mark in the arts and sciences. Pioneering Professor Emerita of Music Charlene Archibeque paved the way for singers, performing artists and music educators. Librarian Mychal Threets, ’18 MLIS, has expanded the definition of “library joy” by creating inclusive spaces in the public library and online. As for the future: the sky’s the limit for Spartan entrepreneurs seeking innovative solutions in every field.While we shed light on tremendous Spartan achievements, we also recognize how common it is to encounter impostor syndrome — the perception that we don’t belong. It is hard to learn, teach and achieve when faced with institutionalized and systemic obstacles. And yet, our students, faculty, alumni and staff prove day in and day out that San José State is a place for “firsts:” first public university on the West Coast, first city-university library, first-generation students.There’s no way to squeeze a century’s worth of Spartans into 32 pages, which is why we invite you to contribute to the San José State story. Tell us about the spaces you found at SJSU — or the places you’ve created since. Show us what being a Spartan means to you.Share your Spartan storyNone of this storytelling is possible without my fellow writers — Cassie Myers, Michelle Smith McDonald, Lesley Seacrist, Amy Villa; our trusty art director and designer Pourya Nadimi; our amazing creative director Michelle Frey; our fantastic illustrator Sierra Ferrato; expert photographers Jim Gensheimer and Robert C.

Institutional Accreditation San José State University (SJSU) is accredited by the WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC), an accrediting agency serving higher education institutions throughout the U.S. and around the world, with most institutions historically in California, Hawaii, and the Pacific region.

Sex-based discrimination and harassment includes sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, sexual exploitation, dating violence, domestic violence, stalking, and pregnancy and parenting discrimination. Make A Report Introducing the Office for Title IX and Equal Opportunity The Office for Title IX and Equal Opportunity combines two prior offices: the Title IX and Gender Equity Office and the Office for Equal Opportunity. We created this new office to simplify the reporting process by establishing one place for all reports of protected status discrimination and harassment, including sex-based harassment, sexual misconduct, dating and domestic violence, stalking, and related retaliation. The office will offer support and resources for those who are impacted by protected status discrimination, harassment, and related retaliation; disciplinary investigations involving any violation of the CSU Nondiscrimination Policy; and trainings on the office’s services, as well as the CSU's policies on discrimination, harassment, sex-based misconduct, and related retaliation. Resources For Complainants Please contact us for support and options if you have experienced discrimination, harassment or retaliation, including sex-based misconduct Learn More For Respondents Please contact us for support and options if you have been accused of discrimination, harassment or retaliation, including sex-based misconduct. Learn More For Witnesses Please contact us for support and options if you have witnessed discrimination, harassment or retaliation, including sex-based misconduct Learn More Title IX at SJSU Title IX Annual Report Interactive Dashboard AY 2023-24 Title IX Annual Report AY 2023-24 There is an important distinction between a “report and a “complaint.” A report is any information received by the then-Title IX Office about suspected Title IX misconduct, and can be made by anyone who is aware of that information. A report could come from the person who experienced the harm, a concerned community member, or a Responsible Employee. A complaint is an official request for an investigation and may only be made by the person who experienced the harm, or the university. A complaint results in an investigation where the facts, taken as true, establish a possible violation of the CSU Nondiscrimination Policy. Because we generally only initiate an investigation upon request, the number of reports reflected in the data is greater than the number of investigations opened by the Title IX Office. Access the Title IX Annual Report Now SJSU’s Statement of Nondiscrimination The University is dedicated to the principles of equal opportunity and non-discrimination. These principles permeate all facets of university life: in the admission, housing and education of students; in policies and practices governing programs of extracurricular life and activities; and in the employment of faculty, staff, and students. Discrimination of any kind, including, but not limited to age, ancestry, color, creed, disability, marital status, medical condition, national origin, pregnancy, race, religion, sex, or sexual orientation, is an affront to the entire university community and is strictly prohibited. SJSU’s Title IX Statement of Nondiscrimination SJSU is committed to maintaining an inclusive community that values diversity and fosters tolerance and mutual respect. SJSU does not discriminate, and does not tolerate discrimination, on the basis of sex or gender, which includes gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation or sex stereotype in its education programs or activities. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, and certain other federal and state laws, prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex in employment, as well as in all education programs and activities operated by the university (both on and off campus). The protection against discrimination on the basis of gender or sexual orientation includes sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, and dating and domestic violence, and stalking. What are the Protected Statuses? Please contact us if you want to discuss a problem or need to make a report relating to discrimination on the basis of a legally protected status, harassment based on the basis of a legally protected status, sexual misconduct or sexual harassment, or retaliation because of your opposition to any such conduct, or your participation in an inquiry or investigation relating to discrimination or harassment. Protected statuses, as listed in the CSU Nondiscrimination Policy, and identified under California and United States law, are: AgeDisability (physical and mental)Gender (or sex, including sex stereotyping)Gender Identity (including transgender)Gender ExpressionGenetic InformationMarital StatusMedical ConditionNationalityPregnancy or Parenting ConcernsRace or Ethnicity (including color, caste, or ancestry)Religion (or religious creed)Sexual Orientation, andVeteran or Military Status.

Derrick Liu/sv-dsa.org-CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Working to Combat Systemic Racism at SJSU Though we are proud to be one of the most diverse campus communities in the nation, action is needed more than ever to address systemic racism at San José State University. And action is what we are taking. The President’s Leadership team on Equity and Justice is facilitating and coordinating the university’s initiatives on racial equity and justice. This leadership team is charged with understanding the initiatives being generated on campus and the tracking of the follow-through in achieving the goals of those initiatives. Learn about SJSU’s immediate steps—as well as intermediate and long-term plans—to create permanent organizational change with regard to systemic racism on our campus. COVID-19 and Anti-Asian Bias COVID-19 and Anti-Asian Bias Anti-immigrant sentiment, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, and other forms of bias have always been with us. The current pandemic has seen an exponential rise in anti-Asian discrimination and milder microaggressions. We recognize the horrific disparities in higher morbidity and infection rates for Black/African Americans, Native Americans, and Latinx peoples from COVID-19 across the country. These collective realities have a great impact on the climate, organizational identity, and retention of employees. Crafted within the complex cultural and political contexts of the Bay Area, this webinar will (1) introduce historical and social psychological frameworks for organizational leaders and team members to understand the dynamics of COVID-19 xenophobia and bias, and (2) offer research-informed interventions and strategies to address anti-Asian bias incidents when they occur in the context of crisis. Target participants span from team members to people who hold positions of leadership in their organizations. Watch this webinar Engaged Inclusive Campus Through its leadership and work, the ODEI encourages civic and communal responsibility for diversity, equity and inclusion amongst its students, faculty, staff and administrators. The ODEI seeks to build organizational capacity to support and grow meaningful and collaborative working relations to provide opportunities for all members of our campus community to further their education and development as lifelong learners within their arena of work or schooling.

Furthermore, the San José State University community recognizes that the university is established within the Thámien Ohlone-speaking tribal ethnohistoric territory, which based upon the unratified federal treaties of 1851-1852, includes the unceded ancestral lands of the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe of the San Francisco Bay Area. Some of the enrolled Muwekma lineages are descended from direct ancestors from the Thámien Ohlone tribal territory whose ancestors had affiliation with Mission Santa Clara. The San José State University community also recognizes the importance of this land to the indigenous Muwekma Ohlone people of this region, and consistent with our principles of community and diversity strives to be good stewards on behalf of the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe whose land we occupy. The portion of this video above (beginning at 6:25) provides important context for the Land Acknowledgement that was generously given to SJSU by the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe for SJSU use. Tribe Chairwoman Charlene Nijmeh gives a powerful detailed accounting of the specific steps and history of the disenfranchisement of the Muwekma Ohlone peoples, as well as the strength and presence of their community today. Tribe Vice Chairwoman Monica V. Arellano gives a detailed context to understand our presence on the ancestral lands of the Muwekma Ohlone, land on which our institution and the city of San Jose occupy. Their leadership reminds us of how much further we have to go, and that this Land Acknowledgement is a very small step towards further action. We are grateful for Charlene Nijmeh and Monica V. Arellano of the Muwekma Ohlone Tribal Council for providing SJSU with a Land Acknowledgement and Greeting. We encourage you to use the Land Acknowledgment in its entirety out of respect for the process and words given us by the Muwekma Ohlone.

Please read this Notice carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. This Notice reflects the University's current practices and may change from time to time, so please check the Notice periodically for updates.

Cookie Policy Cookies Information When you visit the Sites, we may send one or more cookies – a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Sites. A cookie does not collect personal information about you. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Sites. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser's directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Sites or services may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. Google Analytics We use a tool called \"Google Analytics,\" a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. to collect information about use of the Sites. We use Advertising Features within Google Analytics, including Google Signals, remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, and Google Search Console. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit our Sites, what pages are visited, demographics and interests reporting, and what other sites were visited prior to coming to our Sites. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve the Sites. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Sites, rather than your name or other identifying information. Google Analytics will also collect contextual information, such as type of web browser, type of operating system, browser resolution, and network location, however we do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Sites, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Sites is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to the Sites by disabling cookies on your browser, however, please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Sites. You may also opt-out of the Google Analytics Advertising Features through Ads Settings, Ad Settings for mobile apps, or any other available means, such as the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on. Log File Information Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you register with or view our Sites, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol addresses or other device identifiers, browser information, Internet Service Provider, operating system, location, date/time stamp, clickstream data, referring/exit pages and URLs, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. Clear Gifs Information When you use the Sites, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. No personal information is collected using these clear gifs. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. California Do Not Track Disclosures California Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how a website operator responds to \"Do Not Track\" (DNT) browser settings. DNT is a feature offered by some browsers which, when enabled, sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing is not tracked, such as by third party ad networks, social networks and analytic companies. We do not engage in the collection of personally identifiable information about users' online activities over time and across third party websites when an individual uses our Sites and therefore do not respond to DNT signals. How we share your information We share your information internally at the CSU to facilitate and manage the purposes listed above, including with third parties whom the University engages to process your personal information on our behalf for the purposes stated above (such as vendors who help the University with our marketing, application processing, financial aid or payment processing, education management, and web hosting). The University may also share your personal data with government and law enforcement agencies or regulators (1) to comply with a legal process, subpoena, order or other legal or regulatory requirement applicable to us; (2) to enforce our terms of use or other policies; or (3) to pursue available legal remedies or defend against legal claims. We may also share your personal information with a third party as requested by you if permitted by this and other University policies and applicable laws and regulations. We will not distribute or share any electronically collected personal information (as defined in subdivision (d) of California Government Code section 11015.5) about users to any third party without prior written permission from the user except in narrow circumstances involving possible violations of Section 502 of the Penal Code or as authorized under law (including but not limited to the Information Practices Act), or to assist another state agency or public law enforcement organization in any case where the security of a network operated by a state agency has been, or is suspected of having been, breached. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our Sites or services for illegal activities. We may report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful. Release of your personal information for security purposes, as described in this Notice to any person or entity, including, without limitation, in connection with any government investigation or litigation, shall be based on a determination made solely by us, as permitted by law or, for those not in the EEA, exercising our discretion for which you expressly grant permission to us in accordance with this Notice. How we protect your information We take reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information against loss, unauthorized access, and illegal use or disclosure. Such personal information is stored by the University in secure locations and University staff is trained on procedures for the management of personal information, including limitations on the release of information. Access to personal information is limited to those members of the University's staff whose work requires such access. Confidential information is destroyed according to the University's records retention schedule. The University conducts periodic reviews to ensure that proper information management policies and procedures are understood and followed. The security of your personal information is important to us, but please remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to the Sites, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, we make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. While we strive to protect your personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online. We encourage all individuals to use appropriate safeguards to secure their computers and the information on those computers. For additional information on online privacy and security, please see the University's policies and procedures related to Information Security [pdf]; you may also consult with the California Attorney General's Privacy Enforcement and Protection website. In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will promptly investigate and notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in the CSU Information Security Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law. Links to Other Websites We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our Sites nor the information or content contained in them, and we make no warranty, either express or implied, concerning the content of any such site, including the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or suitability of them for any particular purpose, nor do we warrant that any such site or content is free from any claims of copyright, trademark, or other infringement of the rights of third parties, or that any such site or content is devoid of viruses or other contamination. We may provide links to other websites to you solely as a convenience, and the inclusion of linked sites does not imply endorsement by the University or CSU of any of the linked sites. Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Sites to another website, our Notice is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our Sites, is subject to that website's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding. We do not ensure the security of your personal information if you visit websites not belonging to CSU, nor are we the data controller for any information collected on those sites unless we specifically state so. We further reserve the right to terminate a link to a third party site at any time.

We provide resources and services for SJSU students facing unexpected financial crises. If you’re having trouble paying for food, housing or other bills, come to us to get the help you need. Request assistance now and we'll contact you to discuss next steps, eligibility, and possible campus and community resources. Request Assistance Now Food Assistance Are you finding yourself struggling to afford food while attending SJSU? You are not alone. The most recent Student Affairs survey found that approximately half of SJSU students are sometimes skipping meals due to cost. The good news is SJSU Cares has two great programs to help: Spartan Food Pantry CalFresh Application Assistance These programs can help you get the food you need to focus on your education. Additionally, there are many other food resources available on campus and in the surrounding community. Housing Assistance As a student, you may find yourself unexpectedly homeless if you lack stable, regular and adequate housing. You may be homeless if you are living in shelters, parks, motels or cars, or temporarily couch-surfing with other people because you have nowhere else to go. If you are living in any of these situations because you are fleeing an abusive parent or guardian, you may be considered homeless even if they would provide support and a place to live. Or you may have an unexpected eviction, fire or other disaster where you are living. Housing insecurity is a real issue in Silicon Valley. Please contact SJSU Cares if you are in an emergency situation! Medical Assistance Skipping an urgent medical or dental appointment because a lack of resources or insurance can lead to an unhealthy situation. Unexpected medical bills can seriously impact a student's monthly budget. Contact SJSU Cares to find out what resources are available to help you pay for medical bills or insurance. We want to help you stay healthy! Emergency/Disaster Assistance Students share with us when they may have been a victim of a crime such as theft or burglary, or of a natural disaster like fire or flood, which has negatively affected their ability to succeed on campus. If you are facing any kind of emergency situation, contact SJSU Cares to find support and resources. Clothing Assistance The Career Closet, operated by the Career Center, has a focus on providing students with free professional clothing and up to one full professional outfit per academic year. This can assist with interviews, job fairs, etc. Visit thier website to make an appointment. Parenting Students Assistance California Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) The California Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) promotes the health of low-income pregnant, postpartum, and breastfeeding people, infants, and children up to age 5 who are at nutritional risk by providing nutritious food to supplement diets, information on healthy eating including breastfeeding promotion and support, and referrals to health care. You may qualify if you receive Medi-Cal, CalWORKs (TANF) or CalFresh (SNAP) benefits. WIC welcomes military families, migrant families, fathers, foster parents and legal guardians with eligible children. Participating in the WIC program does not affect the immigration status of anyone currently in the U.S. Use the WIC eligibility assessment tool to see if you qualify. Set up an appointment at a WIC local agency near you. Visit the website for WIC families to find a WIC local agency site near you. Diapers Multiple community based agencies indicate that they have assistance with diapers through their programs. Knowing that our students live in many communities it is best to search for diaper assistance by your location. Personal Hygiene Products The Spartan Food Pantry offers menstrual hygiene products for its users. See the pantry website for eligibility. For general locations of free sanitary products on campus visit the Gender Equity Center Sanitary Products page.

Universities like SJSU have a special obligation to encourage and support the free expression of ideas, values, and opinions, even when they may be unpopular or controversial. The university shall ensure that individuals and groups are afforded wide latitude in exercising the right of free expression and that their constitutionally protected right to free expression is protected while on campus. Freedom of expression, however, is not an absolute right and it coexists with other rights and the need for public safety. Loading video content... CSU Interim Free Expression and Time, Place, and Manner Policy The California State University systemwide Interim Free Expression and Time, Place and Manner policy provides regulations to ensure that those who participate in lawful expressive activities are protected and do not disrupt university operations or infringe on the rights of others. SJSU has produced an additional addendum specific to the main campus and affiliated locations. What is Freedom of Speech? Learn how the First Amendment guarantees freedom of speech and how this right is protected here at SJSU. Is There Any Speech Prohibited by the First Amendment? The First Amendment does not prohibit any speech, but there are some types of speech for which there is no, or very limited, First Amendment protection. Recognized Student Organizations SJSU has more than 350 Recognized Student Organizations (RSOs) spanning a wide array of topics, interests and viewpoints. RSOs are free to invite speakers to campus and provide access to campus venues. Election Activities and Other Advocacy SJSU encourages our Spartan community to be civically engaged and make their voices heard on the issues they care about.
